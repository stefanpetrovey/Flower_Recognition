# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Recognition Using Machine Learning ðŸŒ¸
## Overview:
This project aims to classify flower species using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of images of different flowers, and the goal is to train a model that can predict the species of a flower based on its image. By the end of this project, we will have successfully built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras.

### Steps Involved:
**Data Loading:**

  The dataset of flower images is loaded and preprocessed for training. This involves resizing the images and performing necessary data augmentation to improve the modelâ€™s generalization.

**Model Architecture:**

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to classify the flower images. The model architecture is designed to extract features from the images and learn patterns specific to each flower species.

**Model Training:**

The model is trained using the preprocessed dataset. The training process includes optimizing the model using a loss function and adjusting weights based on backpropagation.

**Model Evaluation:*

After training, the model is evaluated on the test data to assess its accuracy and performance.

**Prediction:**

Finally, we use the trained model to make predictions on unseen images, and the model classifies them into one of the flower species.

### Conclusion:
By the end of this project, we successfully trained a model that can predict the species of a flower based on its image. The final model achieves high accuracy and can be used for real-time flower recognition tasks.
